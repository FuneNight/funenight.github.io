Do you imagine someone who spends their days in remote field areas looking at rocks? Our planet and its geology can also be studied from space using only a computer and NASA data. Your challenge is to create an app that enables geologists to use NASA’s Earth observation data to conduct research. Use your imagination to show us that geology doesn’t always require field work to rock!" },
